/*
TO DO APP

1. EASY: First write out the function that will add on to the existing list from the users input.
2. MEDIUM: Create a button at the bottom of the list to clear out the whole list.
3. HARD: With each item that is added, also add a delete button with the ability to delete just that item. NOTE: you may need to look up how to access the li that the button is attached to and how to remove it.
4. NIGHTMARE: Can you figure out a way to edit the task? NOTE: need to add an edit button
